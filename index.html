            <p>Is it strange to have a favorite furnishing in an MMO? I always thought the Dwarven lanterns in 
                ESO were cute and wanted an asset I could use in a TES V: Skyrim mod, so I threw this together in a 
                weekend.

            <p>Over a weekend I decided to teach myself retopology, rebuilding a 3D model with fewer polygons 
                optimized for game design or animation. After practicing with existing models from video games and 
            resource packs, I thought I'd try it with a sculpt of my own!</p>
            <p>As you can see, the retopology has less detail than the original sculpt, but the original sculpt 
                has literally millions of polygons. This makes it difficult for the machine to render quickly in 
                a game or animation environment, so it is advisable to build a slightly simpler retopology for 
                the engine to be able to render the model more easily.

            <p>I've been practicing texturing for character design, developing a kind of painterly style. I prefer 
                more cartoonish styles to realism, taking inspiration from shows like Arcane.
            </p>
            <p>My process for texturing takes place mostly in Blender, which has fairly decent texturing tools. If 
                I need a texture to be more precise, like with the eyes, I'll mark the location on the UV map in 
                Blender and bring it into Photoshop.

            <p>Everyone has an opinion on AI nowadays. Developers are trying very hard to replicate organic 
                neural networks in code. In the story I'm working on, these developers have access to quantum 
                computers and donor brain cells. I needed a "character" design that properly conveyed the horror 
                of a computer that effectively runs on human flesh. I opted for a "Hal 9000 meets XBox" kind of 
                design, a commercial console designed for user appeal but still dangerous looking. I also took 
                inspiration from older car radios, because the aesthetic I'm going for is very neo-eighties.

            <p>Alchemy is one of my favorite characters in ESO. She's a High Elf, a clown, and she's transgender. 
                Her story is sad, she ran away from home because she was being forced into an identity and 
                occupation that wasn't right for her. This story resonated with the LGBTQ community, and in 2019, 
                ESO: Summerset won a GLAAD award for Outstanding Video Game.
            </p>
            <p>I like the character and I like her design, so I remade her mask for use in TES V: Skyrim.</p>

            <p>A while back, at a sidewalk fair outside my apartment, I got half a yard of this fun fabric from 
                someone selling scrap fabric. I had no idea what to do with it, so it sat in my scrap fabric bag 
                for a few years. Then, in 2023, I randomly got the idea to turn it into a cute skirt. I was 
                concerned I wouldn't have enough fabric, but I still managed to make the skirt suitably swishy. 
                When sewing, I generally try to use as much of the fabric I have as I can, minimizing waste. 
                Sustainability is important to me as a seamstress and designer, and my work reflects that.

            <p>This is the first big mod I've released on the Nexus. Before then, most of my mods had been 
                small tweaks and patches for myself. But this one was different, I polished it and put it up 
                online and got tons of downloads overnight. Since then, I've gained over 400 endorsements and 
                over 20k unique downloads.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mod's scenario is simple, the player is a time-traveler that has been underground for a few 
                thousand years. I placed a small room inside a building deep underground in Blackreach with 
                enough starter gear to get the player to the surface. A big draw for the Elder Scrolls is its 
                use of magitech to add sci-fi elements to the medieval fantasy setting, and I'm a big fan of 
                that!

            <p>Around 2021-2022, one of the antagonists of Resident Evil: Village soared in popularity among 
                queer fans on then-Twitter. Lady Dimitrescu gained a sort of cult following, a fandom of her 
                own. I was one of those fans, so naturally I decided to cosplay her (despite being only 5'3").
            </p>
            <p>The dress is a t-shirt dress I got second-hand, and altered by hand on the floor of my dorm room 
                at Sarah Lawrence. Most of my cosplays are second-hand garments that have been altered to look 
                like what the character wears. For the sake of sustainability, I get much of my clothes and 
                fabric second-hand to reduce waste, and try to be mindful of where I source my materials from.

                quality lingerie elastic and very stretchy. In order to accommodate more sizes, my products are 
                mostly made-to-order. Inclusive sizing is very important to me as someone who's struggled to 
                find a bra that fits for most of their life, so I'm making sure that nobody has that issue with 
                my products. Everyone deserves to have cute clothes, I believe this strongly.
